{"google":"","body":"# Captioneer\r\n\r\nWith Captioneer you can easily create your own [Closed Captions for Source-based Games](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Closed_Captions), like for Team Fortress 2.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nMake sure you have [installed the Source SDK](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Installation)!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### 1. Configuration\r\n\r\nCaptioneer is very easy to use. Just edit the `captions.txt` file and add captions in the following format:\r\n\r\n    name: value\r\n\r\nwith one caption per line.\r\n\r\nYou can also use variables, to define them just add a `$` before the name, like so:\r\n\r\n    $my.variable: my value\r\n\r\nTo use variables in your captions, write\r\n\r\n    $(my.variable)\r\n\r\nand the variable value will be inserted.\r\n\r\nAll lines beginning with a `//` or `#` will be treated as comments and ignored.\r\n\r\nYou can find an example already in [`captions.txt`](https://github.com/Philipp15b/Captioneer/blob/master/captions.txt).\r\n\r\n### 2. Compiling\r\n\r\n> `captioneer filename [--language=\"english\"]`\r\n\r\nRun `captioneer` with the filename input path and optionally the language on the command line.\r\nIt will then create a `closecaption_language.dat` in the current directory.\r\n","name":"Captioneer","tagline":"A tool to write and compile closed captions for Source Engine-based games.","note":"Don't delete this file!
